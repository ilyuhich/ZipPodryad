10.10.2020 move my project to github to have comfortable coding from any place
            there is initial models in my base admin account (pass admin)
            have no any pages to show information
            main app is 'ziponline'
    1. now will write main template and first page - it will show me menu and information about last moving
    2. have create first view with warehouse listing and change models. now will create templates
        having a problem with output stor.storage name in template by_storage
        the mistake was that I forget to use {{}}

    3. add templates and moving create form? add base layout
